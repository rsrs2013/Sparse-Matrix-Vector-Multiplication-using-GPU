Error: Error regarding vector file.
Error found near: '../Matrices/mac_econ_fwd500_206500.mtx'
USAGE: spmv -mat [matrix file] -ivec [vector file] -alg [atomic|segment|design] -blockSize [blocksize] -blockNum [blocknum]
Where the order of the parameters and string case do not matter
Though the blockSize is optional (defaults to 1024)
And the algorithms are:
     - atomic =  simple atomics based approach
     - segment = simple segment based scan approach
     - design = design implementation
